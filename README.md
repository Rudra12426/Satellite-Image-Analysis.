# 🛰 Satellite Image Analysis using EuroSAT Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs satellite image analysis using color segmentation techniques 
to identify:

- Water bodies 🌊
- Vegetation 🌿
- Urban areas 🏙

The system processes images efficiently from a single folder 
and visualizes segmented regions using OpenCV and HSV color masking.

## 🧠 Techniques Used
- Image Preprocessing
- HSV Color Space Conversion
- Threshold-Based Segmentation
- Mask Generation
- Visualization using Matplotlib
